# Physical AI Overview

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module provides an introduction to the exciting field of Physical AI - the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with and operate in the physical world. This includes:
- Autonomous robots
- Humanoid robots
- Embodied AI systems
- Robotic manipulation systems
- Navigation and perception systems

## Course Structure

This course is organized into four main modules:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2** - Learn Robot Operating System fundamentals
2. **Module 2: Simulation** - Explore simulation environments for robotics
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - Work with NVIDIA's robotics platform
4. **Module 4: VLA Brain** - Implement Vision-Language-Action models

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of robotics and AI integration
- Be able to develop and deploy robotic systems
- Implement perception, planning, and control algorithms
- Work with state-of-the-art robotics frameworks
- Create intelligent robotic behaviors

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
